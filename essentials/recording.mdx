### What is Recording?

In Paca, recording refers to the process of capturing the series of your web actions on the app. You could click, type, and copy and paste within multiple webpages to make the first recording. 


### How to get started?

1. Download PACA and open side bar
2. Open webpage you want to start from
3. Click 'Recording' Tab and 'Record' button 


### How to record? 

1. As you navigate the web, feel free to click, scroll, and type as you normally would.


<Warning>

Currently, we do not support 'hovering' actions within the web. If you click on any element while hovering over text or components, our extension may not function properly.

</Warning>

2. Keep in mind that what you record will serve as the foundation for what this automation tool will repeat.

3. When you're finished with your recording, simply click the 'Stop' button to end the session.


### How to Confirm?

1. Click the Play button once to check if your recording was captured correctly and functions as intended.

2. You can remove one or more actions from the recording if any were mistakenly included.

3. If you want to edit any part of the recording, we recommend starting a new recording from scratch.
